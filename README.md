PyGNA
=====

PyGNA is a  transformative computational method for automatic discovery
of a set of dynamical rules that best captures both state transition and
topological transformation in the data of spatio-temporal evolution of a
complex network.

The motif-sampling branch is intended to address issues with computational
complexity when using real world temporal network data.  This version of
PyGNA uses a G-Trie for finding isomorphic subgraphs (found in a seperate
repository).

This version is a work in progress and is not "release ready".
